- 1 dimensional array
- 2 dimensional array
- array filled with zero's vs empty array, the empty array is faster but has garbage values
- reshape arrays with the reshape method
- indexing, using fancy indexing
- slicing everything is done with colons and commas
- stacking: vstack, hstack, vsplit, hsplit

- any system of linear equations can be solved with linalg.solv, just need to have the matrix A and
  the 1-D array b
- Determinant of a matrix, if the value is non zero there is exactly one solution. Only applies to
  square matrix (2x2, 3x3, etc.)
- systems with no solutions have a bottom row of something like [ 0.  0. 22.], which means 0 = 22
  this means that the lines dont intersect
- systems with infinite solutions = more variables than equations
